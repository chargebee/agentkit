## Installation

### Cursor

To add this server to Cursor IDE:

1. Navigate to `Cursor Settings` > `MCP`.
2. Click `+ Add new Global MCP Server`.
3. Add the following configuration to your global `.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chargebee": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
          "-y",
          "@chargebee/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Refer to the [Cursor documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for additional details. Note: You can also add this to your project-specific Cursor configuration (supported in Cursor 0.46+).


### Windsurf

To set up MCP with Cascade:

1. Open Windsurf and navigate to `Settings` > `Advanced Settings` or use the Command Palette > `Open Windsurf Settings Page`.
2. Scroll to the Cascade section to add a new server, view existing servers, or access the raw JSON config file at `mcp_config.json`.
3. Click “Add custom server +” to include the Chargebee MCP server directly in `mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chargebee": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
          "-y",
          "@chargebee/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Refer to the [Windsurf documentation](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/mcp) for more information.
